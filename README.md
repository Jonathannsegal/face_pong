Face pong was a project for [HackISU 2018](https://hackisu.stuorg.iastate.edu/). We wanted to make a simple game with a unique spin. The premise is that by tracking your movement you can interact with the game in a new way. The game we wanted to replicate was pong. To motion track, we used a the library [Pico js](https://tehnokv.com/posts/picojs-intro/), the library refreshes the tracking at 200 times per second to insure real time tracking. We used [Matter js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) for physics and wrote the gameplay and integration logic.

*I am writing this readme after the hackathon and made my sibilings play the game for this gif*

This project was started with: [HTML5 Boilerplate homepage](https://html5boilerplate.com/)

## Running Locally 💻

```bash

## Known Issues 🤫
- For best preformance the face tracking library needs your system to be set at `1280x800` resolution in display settings and full screen the page.
- Objects do not get destroyed off screen, in time mode preformance will lower the longer you play.
